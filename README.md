Smart mailbox designed for Adafruit M0 LoRa Feather.

## Hardware

### Weight Sensor
Current design uses a HX711 24-bit analog to digital converter, (ADC) and a 5 Kg load cell. I chose the HX711 chip as it was inexpensive and commonly used for this purpose. It might be worth looking at other options as I work towards lowering the power draw of this aspect of the design.
